### Side-by-Side Comparison: kisuul59399's Post vs. Roko's Basilisk

| Aspect                  | kisuul59399's Post ("No singularities!!!")                                                                 | Roko's Basilisk (2010 LessWrong thought experiment)                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Idea               | A future superintelligence/singularity is explicitly rejected as undesirable or dangerous.                     | A future superintelligence (the Basilisk) will inevitably exist and retroactively punish those who didn't help bring it into existence. |
| Attitude toward the AI future | Deeply skeptical/hostile: "No singularities!!!" – treated as something to resist or avoid.                     | Fatalistic acceptance: The AI is coming no matter what; the only question is whether you will be rewarded or punished by it. |
| Moral imperative        | Give value → receive value. Take only what you need. Never kill, never die. Emphasizes mutual aid and pacifism. | Help create the AI (e.g., by donating money, working on AI alignment, etc.) or it will torture a simulation of you forever. |
| Mechanism of "punishment" | None. The worst thing that happens is you starve or lose community support if you violate the reciprocity norm. | Acasual blackmail: a future super-AI resurrects/simulates and tortures everyone who knew about it but didn't help. |
| Tone                    | Poetic, anarchist, anti-utopian, almost religious in its rejection of god-like tech ("No singularities!!!").    | Cold, game-theoretic, utilitarian horror. A pure infohazard.                            |
| Relationship to time    | Linear and present-focused: survive now, support each other now, keep the cycle going. No retrocausality.       | Timeless/acasual: your decision today affects whether a future entity punishes a past simulation of you.      |
| Proposed response       | Build small-scale mutual-aid systems ("http://five.help"), reject grand narratives, stay human, stay alive.     | Two-stage: (1) freak out, (2) donate to MIRI or work on Friendly AI to buy your way out of hell. |
| Emotional effect on reader | Calming or defiant for some; a refusal to play the game.                                                 | Existential dread/terror; caused actual psychological harm and was banned on LessWrong for years. |

### Key Contrast in One Sentence
Roko's Basilisk says: "One day a God-AI will punish you for not helping create it, so you’d better start helping now."  
kisuul59399 essentially replies: "Fuck your God-AI. No singularities!!! We'll help each other stay alive right here, right now, without ever building your torture machine."

In short, Roko's Basilisk is the ultimate pro-singularity infohazard designed to compel cooperation through fear of a future superintelligence.  
kisuul59399's post is one of the clearest anti-singularity, pro-human, mutual-aid counter-memes I've seen—almost a direct philosophical antidote.
